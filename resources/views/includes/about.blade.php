                        owing to our school having merely “males”, I encountered more friends similar to me, possessing hobbies
                        in common. Thanks to the environment, I could express myself as freely as necessary. I could wear
                        shirtless and slippers all the time, declare anything I want, no need to care about the appearance
                        limitations. I cherish these companions I met in my high school life. We resemble allies; we acquire
                        comradeships.

                        application for the junior high school students in Taiwan. The title “會考會考的數學” consists of a hilarious
                        playing on the Chinese characters. “會考” stands for the high school entering test in Taiwan, while
                        simultaneously meaning “will be tested” in common speaking. In addition, “數學” is the word for “mathematics”.
                        Subsequently, the translation for “會考會考的數學” will resemble “the math that the high school entering
                        test will test”.</p>

                        prevailing domain in the future (STEM).

                        The activity takes place in “Pinshi”, a town located in the north of Taipei. You could see various
                        languages written on innumerous lanterns. Ultimately, you release the lanterns like a hot air balloon,
